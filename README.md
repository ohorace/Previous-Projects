Projects completed in high school and during college

### __*Contents:*__  
**Assembly** - This folder contains two IBM assembler projects I completed at CSU
* *Invoice* - this program prints an invoice statement using an input sheet
* *Amort Schedule* - this program prints an amortized loan schedule from an input sheet. The input sheet contains the loan amount, the monthly payment, the interest rate and the loan term. The output contains the total loan amount and breaks down each monthly payment. Then it has a line for each payment that shows the payment number, the payment amount, how much of the payment was for interest, how much of the payment was for the principal and the remaining loan amount.  
  
**C#** - This folder contains a Bloodbank Project I completed in high school. It is very rough and is not very well implemented. This is before I learned about true OOP. Also, this was completed after learning C# in one school year. Not my best work, included only to show progression from very early coding days to present skill level.
* Bloodbank Class
* Patients Class
* Diagnostics Class

**Compiler Construction** - Contains the program for a simple compiler that I created while doing undergraduate research Fall 2016. This is a very basic compiler that acts as a calculator. It reads an expression from a text file and returns the answer. I did not continue research in Spring 2017 so I was unable to finish my error handling. I started undergraduate research again during Fall 2017 but was given a different topic so I will finish this project in the future. 
* SimpleCompiler Class - tester class, reads inputs and parses it into left and right sub problems by parenthesis
* Parser Class - computes the answer of the equation

**Java** - Contains 3 subcategories: CompSci 2, Data Structures and Misc. 
* *__CompSci 2 > Columbus Zoo:__* this project is a Zoo with a collection of plants and animals in different locations. Plants and animals can be fed, added, removed and searched. This project contains:
   * Animal Class
   * DomesticAnimal Class
   * Plant Class
   * WildAnimal Class
   * Feedable Interface
   * Plant input text file
   * Domesticated Animal input text file
   * Wild Animal input text file
