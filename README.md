Projects completed in high school and during college

*Contents:*  
**C#** - This folder contains a Bloodbank Project I completed in high school. It is very rough and is not very well implemented. This is before I learned about true OOP. Also, this was completed after learning C# in one school year. Not my best work, included only to show progression from very early coding days to present skill level.
