Projects completed in high school and during college

### __*Contents:*__  
**Assembly** - This folder contains two IBM assembler projects I completed at CSU
* *Invoice* - this program prints an invoice statement using an input sheet
* *Amort Schedule* - this program prints an amortized loan schedule from an input sheet. The input sheet contains the loan amount, the monthly payment, the interest rate and the loan term. The output contains the total loan amount and breaks down each monthly payment. Then it has a line for each payment that shows the payment number, the payment amount, how much of the payment was for interest, how much of the payment was for the principal and the remaining loan amount.  
  
**C#** - This folder contains a Bloodbank Project I completed in high school. It is very rough and is not very well implemented. This is before I learned about true OOP. Also, this was completed after learning C# in one school year. Not my best work, included only to show progression from very early coding days to present skill level.
* Bloodbank Class (Tester Class)
* Patients Class
* Diagnostics Class

**Compiler Construction** - Contains the program for a simple compiler that I created while doing undergraduate research Fall 2016. This is a very basic compiler that acts as a calculator. It reads an expression from a text file and returns the answer. I did not continue research in Spring 2017 so I was unable to finish my error handling. I started undergraduate research again during Fall 2017 but was given a different topic so I will finish this project in the future. 
* SimpleCompiler Class - tester class, reads inputs and parses it into left and right sub problems by parenthesis
* Parser Class - computes the answer of the equation

**Java** - Contains 3 subcategories: CompSci 2, Data Structures and Misc. 
* *__CompSci 2 > Columbus Zoo:__* this project is a Zoo with a collection of plants and animals in different locations. Plants and animals can be fed, added, removed and searched. This project contains:
   * Animal Class
   * DomesticAnimal Class
   * Plant Class
   * WildAnimal Class
   * ZooTester Class (Tester Class)
   * Feedable Interface
   * Plant input text file
   * Domesticated Animal input text file
   * Wild Animal input text file
   
* *__Data Structures > Josephus:__* this project uses a Queue to solve the Josephus problem. You enter the number of people in a circle and the position that gets eliminated. It continues until one person is left remaining. This project contains:
   * Josephus Class (Tester Class)
   * MyQueue Class
   * Queue Interface
   
* *__Data Structures > D2BH:__* this project converts a non-negative integer from decimal to binary and hexadecmial using stacks.
   * D2BHTester (Tester Class)
   * D2BHConverter Class
   
* *__Data Structures > TagChecker:__* this project checks the tags in an HTML file. It returns either Balanced or Unbalanced after checking to see if each open tag '<' has a close tag '>'
   * TagChecker (Tester Class)
   * ohoraceSample HTML file
   
* *__Misc > QMC:__* this performs the Quinne-McCluskey operation. I started this project in my spare time after completing the Computer Organization course. I did not complete the implemenation of Quinne-McCluskey in this project. I was able to code all the way to grouping the rows that have the same number of '1's together. I have yet to actually derive the expressions from these groupings. However, this is included just to show work that I have done on my own time.
   * Tester (Tester Class)
   * QMC
   
**Outreach** During my sophomore year in college I volunteered with the program Google Rise and worked with a coordinator at Georgia Tech. During this time, some students and I tutored minority high school students in Computer Science in an attempt to increase AP Computer Science test stores. During this time, I made the worksheet found in this directory as a guide to break down the concept of classes.
* Google Rise Tutorial Document
